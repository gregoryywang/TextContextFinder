# Text Context Finder Chrome Extension

## Overview
Text Context Finder is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the reading experience on web pages, especially content-rich sites like Wikipedia. It allows users to right-click on selected text and find the first relevant context of that text within the article, typically a complete sentence from a paragraph (`<p>` tag) or other meaningful content areas.

## Features
- Context Menu Integration: Right-click to access the feature on any selected text.
- Smart Context Detection: Finds the first occurrence of the selected text within a `<p>` tag and displays the complete sentence that contains it.
- Tooltip Display: Shows the found context in a tooltip near the selected text.

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Unzip (if downloaded as ZIP) and navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in the Chrome browser.
3. Enable "Developer mode" at the top-right.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory of the unzipped extension.
5. The extension should now be installed and ready to use.

## Usage
